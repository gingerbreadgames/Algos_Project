Our task is to determine the maximum enjoyment points that tourists can achieve by selecting experiences on Planet Xanadu,
given the weight constraints of their luggage. This can be solved by breaking the problem into smaller, interdependent subproblems.

Subproblem Explanation:
Imagine you are progressively deciding whether to include each experience in the tourist's luggage.
Each subproblem considers a subset of the experiences (1 to i) and calculates the maximum enjoyment points achievable under a specific luggage weight limit w. 

Let E[ i ][ w ] represent the maximum enjoyment points attainable using the first i experience, without exceeding a luggage weight limit of w.
This answers the question: 
What is the maximum enjoyment that can be achieved by selecting from the first i experiences if the total weight of selected experiences must not exceed w?

Steps of defining the subproblem

1.   Decision Point  
    - At each step i, decide whether to include the i^th  experience in the luggage:
        -   Include:   The  i^th  experience is added to the luggage, adding its weight & enjoyment points.
        -   Exclude:   the  i^th  experience is not included in total enjoyment calculations.
2.   State Transition relations:   the subproblem is solved by recursion by adding smaller subproblems
    - if the weight of the  i^th   experience surpasses the maximum  w   it canâ€™t be included E[i][w] = E[ i  - 1 ][  w  ]
    - Otherwise, the maximum enjoyment is the better of two choices:
        - Exclude the  i^th  experience: E[i- 1][w] 
        - Include the  i^th  experience: Value[i] + E[i-1][w-Weight[i].
            - E[i][w] = max(E[i-1][w],Value[i] + E[i-1][w-Weight[i]
3.   Base Case:   
    - E[0][w] = 0: if no experiences are considered then enjoyment is 0.
    - E[i][0]=0: if the weight limit is 0 then no experiences can occur, so enjoyment is 0.

After solving all subproblems, the solution to the original problem is E[n][W], where n is the total number of experiences and W is the luggage weight limit.
